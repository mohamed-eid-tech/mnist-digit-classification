# 🖥️ MNIST Digit Classification  

## 📌 Description  
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify handwritten digits (0–9) from the **MNIST dataset**.  

The MNIST dataset is a classic benchmark in computer vision and machine learning, containing **70,000 grayscale images** of handwritten digits.  

The goal of this project is to:  
- ✅ Accurately recognize handwritten digits  
- ✅ Generalize well on unseen data through preprocessing and augmentation  
- ✅ Provide an educational example for learning **CNNs** and **PyTorch** workflows  
- ✅ Serve as a foundation for more advanced digit or character recognition tasks

## ⚙️ Project Workflow  
This project demonstrates the complete deep learning pipeline, including:  
1. **Data Handling** → Loading, normalization, and augmentation  
2. **Model Architecture** → CNN with convolutional layers, pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers  
3. **Training Process** → Training with validation, early stopping, and saving the best model  
4. **Prediction** → Preprocessing custom images and classifying them with the trained model
